# Scenario

@Loyn-1987-1987 modelled the abundance of forest birds with six predictor
variables (patch area, distance to nearest patch, distance to nearest larger
patch, grazing intensity, altitude and years since the patch had been isolated).

------- ------ ------- ------ ------- ----- ---------

------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**ABUND**     Abundance of forest birds in patch- response variable
**DIST**      Distance to nearest patch - predictor variable
**LDIST**     Distance to nearest larger patch - predictor variable
**AREA**      Size of the patch - predictor variable
**GRAZE**     Grazing intensity (1 to 5, representing light to heavy) - predictor variable
**ALT**       Altitude - predictor variable
**YR.ISOL**   Number of years since the patch was isolated - predictor variable
------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of the analysis is to investigate the effects of a range of predictors
on the abundance of forest birds.

# Exploratory data analysis {.tabset .tabset-faded}


This is an application of multiple regression.  The response variable in this
instance is a little awkward in that it appears to be an average of multiple
point quadrats rather than a pure count.  Central limits theorem suggests that
averages should follow a normal distribution and thus we might expect that it is
reasonable to model this bird abundance against a Gaussian distribution.
However, this has the potential to become problematic since a Gaussian
distribution can extend below zero whereas this is clearly not logical for bird
abundance.  As a result, we might find the at the model can predict bird
abundances less than zero.   

If this were our own analysis, we might first attempt to model these data
against a Gaussian distribution and then explore whether this could lead to
negative predictions - it may be that the bird abundances are sufficiently high
that the issue of negative predictions is not realised over sensible ranges of
the predictors.  If it turns out that there is an issue, then we would explore
alternatives.

In this case, there is an issue - the model does indeed predict fewer than zero
birds for some ranges of some of the predictors.  Hence, we will skip straight
to the alternatives:

- we could log-transform the response.
$$
log(y_i) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ...
$$
   - the expected values will be the mean of logs
   - due to the transformation, both $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are modelled on a log
     scale.
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{N}(e^{X\beta}, e^{\sigma^2})\\
$$
   - when back-transforming, this implies that the variances will be unequal, in
     fact they will increase with the mean.
$$
log(y_i) = X\beta + \varepsilon \hspace{1cm} \varepsilon \sim{} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
$$
- we could model the data using a Gaussian distribution with a log link.
$$
y_i = \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
log(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ...
$$
   - the expected value will he the log of means
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{N}(e^{X\beta}, \sigma^2)\\
$$
   - the effects (slopes) become multiplicative
$$
log(y_i + \varepsilon) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ... \hspace{1cm} \varepsilon
     \sim{} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
$$
- we could model the data using a Gamma distribution with a log link.
$$
y_i = \mathcal{Gamma}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
log(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ...
$$


We will explore each of these options:

- in doing so, we need to consider the patterns of variance 
- linearity
- (multi)collinearity - correlated predictors should not be in the same model
  together lest they compete.

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$ is a
model matrix representing the additive effects of the scaled versions of
distance (ln), distance to the nearest large patch (ln), patch area (ln),
grazing intensity, year of isolation and altitude on the abundance of forest
birds.


## Gaussian (log-link)

Model formula:
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\

$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$ is a model matrix representing the additive effects of
the scaled versions of distance (ln), distance to the nearest large patch (ln), patch area (ln), grazing intensity, year of isolation and 
altitude on the abundance of forest birds.

$$
