# Scenario

Here is an example from @Fowler-1998-1998. An agriculturalist was interested in
the effects of fertiliser load on the yield of grass.  Grass seed was sown
uniformly over an area and different quantities of commercial fertiliser were
applied to each of ten 1 m<sup>2</sup> randomly located plots.  Two months later
the grass from each plot was harvested, dried and weighed.  The data are in the
file **fertilizer.csv** in the **data** folder.

| FERTILIZER   | YIELD   |
| ------------ | ------- |
| 25           | 84      |
| 50           | 80      |
| 75           | 90      |
| 100          | 154     |
| 125          | 148     |
| \...         | \...    |

---------------- ---------------------------------------------------
**FERTILIZER**:  Mass of fertiliser (g.m^-2^) - Predictor variable
**YIELD**:       Yield of grass (g.m^-2^) - Response variable
---------------- ---------------------------------------------------

 
The aim of the analysis is to investigate the relationship between fertiliser
concentration and grass yield.

# Read in the data


```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
fert = read_csv('../data/fertilizer.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
```


```{r examinData}
glimpse(fert)
## Explore the first 6 rows of the data
head(fert)
str(fert)
```

# Exploratory data analysis


Model formula:
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i
$$

where $y_i$ represents the $i$ observed values, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$
represent the intercept and slope respectively, and $\sigma^2$ represents the
estimated variance.

Although there are numerous easy to use routines that will generate partial
plots (see above), it is also useful to be able to produce the data behind the
figures yourself.  That way, you can have more control over the type and style of
the figures.

Producing a summary figure is essentially plotting the results of predictions.
In the case of a trend, we want a series of predictions associated with a
sequence of predictor values.  Hence, we establish a prediction grid that
contains the sequence of values for the predictor we would like to display.

There are a number of functions we can use to generate different sequences of
prediction values.  For example, we may want a sequence of values from the
lowest to the highest observed predictor value.  Alternatively, we may just want
to explore predictions at the first, third and fifth quantiles.  The following
table indicates some of the functions that are helpful for these purposes.

| Function                   | Values returned                                         |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `modelr::seq_range()`      | equal increment values from smallest to largest         |
| `Hmisc::smean_sdl()`       | mean as well as mean plus/minus one standard deviation  |
| `Hmisc::smedian_hilow()`   | median as well as min and max                           |
| `Hmisc::smean.cl.normal()` | mean as well as lower and upper 95% confidence interval |
