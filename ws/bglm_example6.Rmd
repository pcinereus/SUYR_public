# Scenario

An ecologist studying a rocky shore at Phillip Island, in southeastern Australia, was interested in how
clumps of intertidal mussels are maintained [@Quinn-1988-137]. In particular, he wanted to know how densities of adult
mussels affected recruitment of young individuals from the plankton. As with most marine invertebrates,
recruitment is highly patchy in time, so he expected to find seasonal variation, and the interaction
between season and density - whether effects of adult mussel density vary across seasons - was the aspect
of most interest.

The data were collected from four seasons, and with two densities of adult mussels. The experiment
consisted of clumps of adult mussels attached to the rocks. These clumps were then brought back to the
laboratory, and the number of baby mussels recorded. There were 3-6 replicate clumps for each density
and season combination.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn = read_csv('../data/quinn.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
glimpse(quinn)
summary(quinn)
```

```{r dataprep, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}

# Exploratory data analysis

Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{NB}(\lambda_i, \theta)\\
ln(\mu_i) &= \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i}\\
\beta_0 &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(0,10)\\
\beta_{1,2,3} &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(0,2.5)\\
\theta &\sim{} \mathcal{Exp}(1)
\end{align}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$ is a model matrix representing the intercept and effects of season, density and their interaction on mussel recruitment.
