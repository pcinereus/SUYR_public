# Scenario

An ecologist studying a rocky shore at Phillip Island, in southeastern
Australia, was interested in how clumps of intertidal mussels are maintained
[@Quinn-1988-137]. In particular, he wanted to know how densities of adult
mussels affected recruitment of young individuals from the plankton. As with
most marine invertebrates, recruitment is highly patchy in time, so he expected
to find seasonal variation, and the interaction between season and density -
whether effects of adult mussel density vary across seasons - was the aspect of
most interest.

The data were collected from four seasons, and with two densities of adult
mussels. The experiment consisted of clumps of adult mussels attached to the
rocks. These clumps were then brought back to the laboratory, and the number of
baby mussels recorded. There were 3-6 replicate clumps for each density and
season combination.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn = read_csv('../data/quinn.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
glimpse(quinn)
summary(quinn)
```

Since we intend to model both SEASON and DENSITY as categorical variables, 
we need to explicitly declare them as factors.


# Exploratory data analysis

Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{Pois}(\lambda_i)\\
ln(\mu_i) &= \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i}\\[1em]
\end{align}
$$
                                           
where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$ is a
model matrix representing the intercept and effects of season, density and their
interaction on mussel recruitment.


**Conclusions:**

- there is clear evidence of non-homogeneity of variance
- specifically, there is evidence that the variance is related to the mean in
  that boxplots that are lower on the y-axis (low mean) also have lower variance
  (shorter boxplots)
- this might be expected for count data and we might consider that a Poisson
  distribution (which assumes that mean and variance are equal - and thus
  related in a very specific way).

Lets mimic the effect of using a log link, by using log scaled y-axis.


**Conclusions:**

- that is an improvement

# Predictions


# Summary figures
As these summarise only involve categorical predictors, there is no need to
define a prediction grid.  For categorical predictors, the default grid will
assume that you are interested in all the levels of the categorical predictors.
